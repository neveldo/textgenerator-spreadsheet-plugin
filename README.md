# TextGenerator Spreadsheet plugin

Here is the [TextGenerator Google Spreadsheet plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/textgenerator/lbcccnholajhofhlfhkmjjekklkhhjnf) code. It gives users the ability to produce automated text contents from data directly within Google Spreadsheet. A complete tutorial for the Spreadsheet Add-on is available [here](https://medium.com/@neveldo/tutorial-turn-your-data-into-narratives-using-textgenerator-wikidata-and-google-spreadsheet-b85fad31219a#.w8mi43qwh). 

It is based on the [TextGenerator PHP package](https://github.com/neveldo/TextGenerator) requested as a REST API.
